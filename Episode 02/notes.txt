npm = not stand for node package manager but its manages lots of packages
dependencies 
most importan
bundlers==> whole code need to be bundle/clean/cached so that we can shiped/pushed to production
like - vite/parcel/CRA

two type of dependencies
    1-dev dependencies
     generally require in development not in production
    2- normal dependencies
     generally require in development and also in production

version in dependencies 
    tilde and caret in version 
    ^1.3.4
    if in future minor update then it automatecly updated to latest one i.e 1.3.5
    ~1.2.4
    if in future minor update then it automatecly updated to latest majro one i.e 2.3.5

package.json vs package-lock.json
    package.json : it is configuration for npm it keep track what version of package is installed in our system 
    package-lock.json: keep track of exact version of package | locks the version and keep record of it

transitive dependencies :
when package have another dependencies 

intgrety in package-lock.json is production and local ko same rakhne ke liye hota hai

--------------------------------------part 2---------------------------------------
npx command : executing the package
e.g npx parcel file_name

parcel:
 build the development build 
 and hosted to the server
 refresh page = HMR = Hot module replacement (when change and save it refresh page)
 -file watching algoright written in c++
 - caching faster build
 - image optimization 
 - compress files 
 - minification
 - differential bunding to support older browers
 - consistent hashing
 - Tree shaking - remove unused code

browesrlist :
- its a package that tell which browers compatible for app
- like last 2 chrome versions
- check browesrlist.dev
